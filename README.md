# Time-Wasted-Online

A personal project that just came into mind while browsing on my phone in the bathroom.
This program will parse out information based on my Youtube views and Google search results.

# Purpose

The following is a list of reasons why I have decided to start this small project.

* Have a better picture on how much I waste my time browsing the web.
* Have some fun in exploring my habits and patterns using programming.
* Practice my skills!
